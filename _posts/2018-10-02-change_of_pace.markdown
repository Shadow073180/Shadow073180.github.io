It started back in 2013 when i started pursuing a bachelors in Music Production. In 2016 I graduated with my degree and landed an internship as a mixing engineer. After my internship i was unable to start a career in my degree choice so i ended going back on the road as an over the road truck driver. I don't want to be a trucker the rest of my life and I really love technology. I am constantly seeing job opening for web developers and software developers. I tried doing some coding tests and came across the FlatIron school program for software engineering. 
I started doing coding when learning to create video games and absolutely had a blast. It is amazing to me how text can create an object and give that object attributes to make it react as it would in the real world. I am loving this course and really looking forward to what's ahead.
