<b>I'm starting to get really frustrated!</b> I started off awesome in this program, but now it seems like I have hit a wall. I am now on the Object Relationships lab and I just keep repeating the same errors. I don't know if this is supposed to be a venting blog, but the subject said <b>Stuck! Write about it.</b> so here i am. The relationships and interaction between these objects should be as confusing as this to me. Should they? Oh well on to another session with this lab, wish me luck!
